  abstract = {The dual role of microglia in cytotoxicity and neuroprotection is
	believed to depend on the specific, temporal expression of microglial-related
	genes. To better clarify this issue, we used high-density oligonucleotide
	microarrays to examine microglial gene expression after spinal cord
	injury (SCI) in rats. We compared expression changes at the lesion
	site, as well as in rostral and caudal regions after mild, moderate,
	or severe SCI. Using microglial-associated anchor genes, we identified
	two clusters with different temporal profiles. The first, induced
	by 4 h postinjury to peak between 4 and 24 h, included interleukin-1beta,
	interleukin-6, osteopontin, and calgranulin, among others. The second
	was induced 24 h after SCI, and peaked between 72 h and 7 days; it
	included C1qB, Galectin-3, and p22(phox). These two clusters showed
	similar expression profiles regardless of injury severity, albeit
	with slight decreases in expression in mild or severe injury vs.
	moderate injury. Expression was also decreased rostral and caudal
	to the lesion site. We validated the expression of selected cluster
	members at the mRNA and protein levels. In addition, we demonstrated
	that stimulation of purified microglia in culture induces expression
	of C1qB, Galectin-3, and p22(phox). Finally, inhibition of p22(phox)
	activity within microglial cultures significantly suppressed proliferation
	in response to stimulation, confirming that this gene is involved
	in microglial activation. Because microglial-related factors have
	been implicated both in secondary injury and recovery, identification
	of temporally distinct clusters of genes related to microglial activation
	may suggest distinct roles for these groups of factors.},

	stroke at initial examination, incidence of stroke has decreased
	over the past 50 years but the lifetime risk has not declined to
	the same degree, perhaps due to improved life expectancy. The results
	of this study suggest that improved control of risk factors has lowered
	stroke incidence but emphasize the need for continued primary prevention

  abstract = {The present review presents a series of concepts that may be useful
	in developing rehabilitative strategies to enhance recovery of posture
	and locomotion following spinal cord injury. First, the loss of supraspinal
	input results in a marked change in the functional efficacy of the
	remaining synapses and neurons of intraspinal and peripheral afferent
	(dorsal root ganglion) origin. Second, following a complete transection
	the lumbrosacral spinal cord can recover greater levels of motor
	performance if it has been exposed to the afferent and intraspinal
	activation patterns that are associated with standing and stepping.
	Third, the spinal cord can more readily reacquire the ability to
	stand and step following spinal cord transection with repetitive
	exposure to standing and stepping. Fourth, robotic assistive devices
	can be used to guide the kinematics of the limbs and thus expose
	the spinal cord to the new normal activity patterns associated with
	a particular motor task following spinal cord injury. In addition,
	such robotic assistive devices can provide immediate quantification
	of the limb kinematics. Fifth, the behavioural and physiological
	effects of spinal cord transection are reflected in adaptations in
	most, if not all, neurotransmitter systems in the lumbosacral spinal
	cord. Evidence is presented that both the GABAergic and glycinergic
	inhibitory systems are up-regulated following complete spinal cord
	transection and that step training results in some aspects of these
	transmitter systems being down-regulated towards control levels.
	These concepts and observations demonstrate that (a) the spinal cord
	can interpret complex afferent information and generate the appropriate
	motor task; and (b) motor ability can be defined to a large degree
	by training.},

	a predictor of mortality, as well as factors that may explain this
	association. Data are drawn from the Whitehall II longitudinal cohort
	study of British civil servants. The analyses are based on 6,266
	participants (29\% women; mean age = 61 years, SD = 6) for whom "walking
	speed at usual pace" was measured over 8 ft (2.44 m) at baseline.
	Participants were followed for all-cause and cause-specific mortalities
	during a mean of 6.4 (SD = 0.8) years. During this period, 227 participants
	died. Participants in the bottom sex-specific third of walking speed
	(men, <1.26 m/s; women, <1.09 m/s) had an increased risk of death
	compared to those in the middle and top thirds (age- and sex-adjusted
	hazard ratio = 1.89, 95\% confidence interval (CI) = 1.45-2.46),
	with no evidence of effect modification by age or sex (interactions,
	P ? 0.40). The association between walking speed and mortality was
	partially explained by baseline inflammatory markers (percentage
	reduction of the association 22.8\%), height and body mass index
	(16.6\%), chronic diseases (14.0\%), and health behaviors (13.4\%).
	Together these and other baseline factors (socioeconomic status,
	cardiovascular risk factors, cognitive function) explained 48.5\%
	of the association (adjusted hazard ratio = 1.39, 95\% CI = 1.04-1.84).
	In conclusion, walking speed measured in late midlife seems to be
	an important marker of mortality risk; multiple factors, in particular
	inflammatory markers, partially explain this association.},

	Although considered safe by the US Food and Drug Administration,

	With an increased use of BTX-A for neuromuscular disorders, the effects
	of repeat injections of BTX-A on strength, muscle mass and structure
	need to be known. Therefore, the purpose of this study was to investigate
	the changes in strength, muscle mass and contractile material in
	New Zealand White (NZW) rabbits. Twenty NZW rabbits were divided
	into 4 groups: control and 1, 3 and 6 months of unilateral, repeat
	injections of BTX-A into the quadriceps femoris. Outcome measures
	included knee extensor torque, muscle mass and the percentage of
	contractile material in the quadriceps muscles of the target and
	non-injected contralateral hindlimbs. Strength in the injected muscles
	was reduced by 88\%, 89\% and 95\% in the 1, 3 and 6 months BTX-A

	51\% and 50\% at 3 months and by 76\%, 44\% and 13\% at 6 months.
	The percentage of contractile material was reduced for the 3 and

	by fat. Similar, but less pronounced results were also observed for
	the quadriceps muscles of the contralateral hindlimbs, suggesting

	surgeons prospectively evaluated 36 consecutive adult patients with
	a spastic equinovarus deformity of the foot and ankle. After an initial
	history and physical exam, each surgeon independently formulated
	a surgical plan. Surgical treatment options for each individual muscle/tendon
	unit crossing the ankle included lengthening, transfer, release or
	no surgery. After the initial clinical evaluation and surgical planning,
	all patients then underwent instrumented gait analysis collecting
	kinetic, kinematic and poly-EMG data using a standard protocol by
	a single experienced physiatrist. Each surgeon reviewed the gait
	studies and patients independently and again formulated a surgical
	plan. The surgical plans were compared for each surgeon before and
	after gait study. The agreement between the two surgeon's surgical
	plans was also compared before and after gait study. Each patient
	was evaluated for the clinical outcome of surgery.Overall a change
	was made in 64\% of the surgical plans after the gait study. The
	frequency of changing the surgical plan was not significantly different

	surgeons increased from 0.34 to 0.76 (p=0.009) after the gait study.
	The number of surgical procedures planned by each surgeon converged

	in surgical planning.The equinovarus deformity is due to a variety
	of deforming forces and a single, best operation does not exist to
	correct all equinovarus deformities. Rather, a muscle specific approach
	that identifies the deforming forces will produce the best outcomes

	with spinal cord transection at T13 some weeks or months previously.
	In control cats, the highest levels of alpha1-noradrenergic receptors,

	alpha2-noradrenergic receptors, labeled with [3H]idazoxan, were found

	IX. After spinal transection, both receptors did not change in segments

	significantly increased in laminae II, III, IV, and X for alpha2

  abstract = {BACKGROUND- Simultaneous contribution of hundreds of electrocardiographic
	(ECG) biomarkers to prediction of long-term mortality in postmenopausal
	women with clinically normal resting ECGs is unknown. METHODS AND
	RESULTS- We analyzed ECGs and all-cause mortality in 33 144 women
	enrolled in the Women's Health Initiative trials who were without
	baseline cardiovascular disease or cancer and had normal ECGs by
	Minnesota and Novacode criteria. Four hundred and seventy-seven ECG
	biomarkers, encompassing global and individual ECG findings, were
	measured with computer algorithms. During a median follow-up of 8.1
	years (range for survivors, 0.5 to 11.2 years), 1229 women died.
	For analyses, the cohort was randomly split into derivation (n=22
	096; deaths, 819) and validation (n=11 048; deaths, 410) subsets.
	ECG biomarkers and demographic and clinical characteristics were
	simultaneously analyzed using both traditional Cox regression and
	random survival forest, a novel algorithmic machine-learning approach.
	Regression modeling failed to converge. Random survival forest variable
	selection yielded 20 variables that were independently predictive
	of long-term mortality, 14 of which were ECG biomarkers related to
	autonomic tone, atrial conduction, and ventricular depolarization
	and repolarization. CONCLUSIONS- We identified 14 ECG biomarkers
	from among hundreds that were associated with long-term prognosis
	using a novel random forest variable selection methodology. These
	biomarkers were related to autonomic tone, atrial conduction, ventricular
	depolarization, and ventricular repolarization. Quantitative ECG
	biomarkers have prognostic importance and may be markers of subclinical
	disease in apparently healthy postmenopausal women.},

	How the variation in each parameter will influence the mechanical
	behavior of patients with spasticity is not well understood because
	of the difficulty in experimentally isolating individual parameters.
	A neuromuscular dynamic model, based on the pendulum test of spasticity,
	has been developed to study the specific contribution of individual
	parameter abnormalities in stretch reflex loops to the observed mechanical
	abnormalities. The model contains detailed nonlinear dynamics of
	muscle force generation and stretch reflexes. A computer simulation
	of the model indicates that the stretch reflex thresholds and the
	gain have different influences on the leg swing in the pendulum test
	of spasticity. Individual changes in the static stretch reflex threshold,
	in the dynamic threshold, or in the gain can not stimulate the whole
	spectrum of spasticity severity. When simultaneous changes in all
	three parameters of the stretch reflex loop occur, a small variation
	of the gain coupled with changes in both static and dynamic thresholds
	can produce increasing severity of spasticity as the thresholds further
	decrease. The model is also successful in simulating the effect of
	posture changes on spasticity.},

  abstract = {The spinal cord is usually part of the treatment volume in the treatment
	of the thorax and abdomen areas using antero-posterior (AP) and postero-anterior
	(PA) ports. Thus it is necessary to know the dose the spinal cord
	would receive. One needs to locate the spine to calculate the dose
	at that location. In the absence of CT, a set of orthogonal films
	is taken at simulation to aid in locating the spine. The relative
	point dose then is calculated using irregular field point dose calculation
	mode of the treatment planning system. The data needed for the calculation
	are the x and y coordinates of the spine in the coronal plane, air
	gap, and depth in tissue. Correct entry of these is thus important
	to obtain the dose accurately. Planning systems assume that the spine
	is close to the beam axis. There could be possible mislocation of
	the spine when this assumption is not valid. This presentation describes
	a procedure to obtain the needed numbers for a general location without
	any assumptions. To obtain x and y coordinates the suggestion is
	made to solve numerically using successive approximation series for
	the coordinates, the series continued until mutually consistent values
	are obtained. The other parameters, g and d, are obtained from the

	1 year after treatment and rehabilitation on a stroke unit versus
	on general neurological and medical wards in unselected stroke patients.
	In the present study we wanted to test the hypothesis that this mortality-reducing
	effect is not temporary but is long lasting.We performed a community-based
	comparison of outcome in 1241 stroke patients from 2 adjacent communities
	in Copenhagen: in one (Frederiksberg), treatment and rehabilitation
	were provided on general neurological and medical wards, and in the
	other (Bispebjerg), treatment and rehabilitation were provided on
	a single large stroke unit.The 2 stroke populations were comparable
	regarding age, sex, initial stroke severity, lesion diameter on CT,
	and stroke subtype (hemorrhage/infarct), but patients treated on
	the stroke unit had a higher frequency of comorbidity and lower incomes.
	One-year mortality was 39\% (general wards) versus 32\% (stroke unit)
	(P=0.01). This difference was still present 5 years after stroke
	(71\% versus 64\%; P=0.02). In a multiple logistic regression model
	of 5-year mortality, treatment on a stroke unit reduced the relative
	risk of death by 40\% (odds ratio, 0.60; 95\% CI, 0.42 to 0.85; P<0.01),
	independent of age, sex, stroke severity, and comorbidity.The mortality-reducing
	effect of treatment and rehabilitation on a dedicated stroke unit
	is long lasting rather than temporary. Stroke unit treatment reduced
	the relative risk of death within 5 years after stroke by 40\% in
	an unselected, community-based stroke population. These results emphasize
	the need for organization of treatment and rehabilitation of unselected
	stroke patients on dedicated stroke units.},

	(1) torque and EMG measurements during ramp and hold angular displacement

	Temporal reproducibility of a test for a given subject was evaluated

	the effects of stress and glucocorticoids on spines during the postnatal

	the formation and elimination of dendritic spines in vivo after treatment
	with glucocorticoids in developing and adult mice. Corticosterone,
	the principal murine glucocorticoid, had potent dose-dependent effects
	on dendritic spine dynamics, increasing spine turnover within several
	hours in the developing barrel cortex. The adult barrel cortex exhibited
	diminished baseline spine turnover rates, but these rates were also
	enhanced by corticosterone. Similar changes occurred in multiple
	cortical areas, suggesting a generalized effect. However, reducing
	endogenous glucocorticoid activity by dexamethasone suppression or
	corticosteroid receptor antagonists caused a substantial reduction
	in spine turnover rates, and the former was reversed by corticosterone
	replacement. Notably, we found that chronic glucocorticoid excess
	led to an abnormal loss of stable spines that were established early
	in life. Together, these findings establish a critical role for glucocorticoids

	using the scores at 1 month produced the highest r2 values (range

	activities (constitutive and inducible) in the site of injury in
	response to Th10-Th11 spinal cord hemisection and, to determine whether
	unilateral disconnection of the spinal cord influences the NOS pools
	on the contra- and ipsilateral sides in segments located far away
	from the epicentre of injury. 2. A radioassay detection was used
	to determine Ca(2+)-dependent and inducible nitric oxide synthase
	activities. Somal, axonal and neuropil neuronal nitric oxide synthase
	was assessed by immunocytochemical study. A quantitative assessment
	of neuronal nitric oxide synthase immunoreactivity was made by an
	image analyser. The level of neuronal nitric oxide synthase protein
	was measured by the Western blot analysis. 3. Our data show the increase
	of inducible nitric oxide synthase activity and a decrease of Ca(2+)-dependent
	nitric oxide synthase activity in the injured site analysed 1 and
	7 days after surgery. In segments remote from the epicentre of injury
	the inducible nitric oxide synthase activity was increased at both
	time points. Ca(2+)-dependent nitric oxide synthase activity had
	decreased in L5-S1 segments in a group of animals surviving for 7
	days. A hemisection performed at thoracic level did not cause significant
	difference in the nitric oxide synthase activities and in the level
	of neuronal nitric oxide synthase protein between the contra- and
	ipsilateral sides in C6-Th1 and L5-S1 segments taken as a whole.
	Significant differences were observed, but only when the spinal cord
	was analysed segment by segment, and/or was divided into dorsal and
	ventral parts. The cell counts in the cervicothoracic (C7-Th1) and
	lumbosacral (L5-S1) enlargements revealed changes in neuronal nitric
	oxide synthase immunoreactivity on the ipsilateral side of the injury.
	The densitometric area measurements confirmed the reduction of somal,
	neuropil and axonal neuronal nitric oxide synthase immunoreactive
	staining in the ventral part of rostrally oriented segments. 4. Our
	findings provide evidence that the changes in nitric oxide synthase
	pools are limited not only to impact zone, but spread outside the
	original lesion. The regional distribution of nitric oxide synthase
	activity and neuronal nitric oxide synthase immunoreactivity, measured
	segment by segment shows that nitric oxide may play a significant
	role in the stepping cycle in the quadrupeds.},

	concentrations. As a step towards understanding the complex mechanisms
	underlying repair and regeneration after SCI, the gene expression
	pattern was examined 4.5 days after complete transection at T8-9
	level of rat spinal cord. Improved subtractive hybridization was
	used to establish a subtracted cDNA library using cDNAs from normal
	rat spinal cord as driver and cDNAs from injured spinal cord as tester.
	By expressed sequence tag (EST) sequencing, we obtained 73 EST fragments
	from this library, representing 40 differentially expressed genes.
	Among them, 32 were known genes and 8 were novel genes. Functions
	of all annotated genes were scattered in almost every important field
	of cell life such as DNA repair, detoxification, mRNA quality control,
	cell cycle control, and signaling, which reflected the complexity
	of SCI and regeneration. Then we verified subtraction results with
	semiquantitative RT-PCR for eight genes. These analyses confirmed,
	to a large extent, that the subtraction results accurately reflected
	the molecular changes occurring at 4.5 days post-SCI. The current
	study identified a number of genes that may shed new light on SCI-related
	inflammation, neuroprotection, neurite-outgrowth, synaptogenesis,
	and astrogliosis. In conclusion, the identification of molecular

  abstract = {Stroke is the commonest acquired neurological handicap aecting a
	million patients in the UK
	
	with almost 40% of patients exhibiting spasticity producing poorer
	function[4]. The surgical
	
	 management of immobility after stroke is surprisingly uncommon given
	the size of the problem. 
	
	This study aims to identify a benet of improving walking speed after
	stroke.
	
	
	A consecutive series of patients aected by stroke was examined and
	walking speed over 5 me-
	
	tre bare foot and in shoes measured between 3 and 5 months after a
	stroke. Patients with
	
	other pathologies; dementia or an inability to walk at all were excluded.
	At 10 years after the
	
	stroke the patients were followed up to identify whether they had
	survived. Analysis of the re-
	
	lationship between walking speed and mortality was disentangled from
	the eect of age using
	
	a random forest survival technique[1]. An optimal predictive tree
	allowed the important vari-
	
	ables to be identied and their contributions isolated from other
	eects. Additionally a tra-
	
	ditional Cox proportional hazard estimation was performed to demonstrate
	that the slow-
	
	est quartile for walking speed diered signicantly in their mortality
	from the fastest quartile.
	
	
	As walking speed increases mortality reduces in a linear fashion until
	approximately .85M/s at 
	
	which point further increases in walking speed are related to only
	a modest reduction in mortality.
	
	 An inflexion in the age mortality relationship occurs at 74 years
	of age (27000 days). 
	
	Sex has a minor influence on mortality compared with walking speed.
	
	
	Walking speed is associated with mortality in patients after stroke.
	Whether this is a 
	
	relationship that is amenable to manipulation by altering walking
	speed is untested. 
	
	Interestingly in an ROC analysis of the walking speed needed to achieve
	to avoid dying 
	
	Stanaway et al identied .84M/sec as the cut-o point separating those
	destined for 
	
	an early grave from the long livers[3]. A probable explanation for
	the relationship between
	
	walking speed and mortality is that slow walking speed results from
	a person having 
	
	insucient spare metabolic energy to allow speedy gait. If the subject's
	energetic 
	
	reserve is small, otherwise survivable intercurrent
	
	illness has a chance of overwhelming them leading to death[2].

	clinical applications of TMS and repetitive TMS (rTMS). In these
	years the number of applications of conventional TMS has grown impressively,

	and to the real-time integration of TMS with electroencephalography
	(EEG), positron emission tomography (PET) and functional magnetic

	with various neurological and psychiatric diseases have undergone
	TMS allowing a better assessment of relative risks. The occurrence
	of seizures (i.e., the most serious TMS-related acute adverse effect)

	the hypothesis that slower gait at older ages may reflect a compensatory
	action to offset the greater energetic cost of walking associated
	with aging and chronic conditions. Future studies should evaluate
	the specific mechanisms that contribute to this phenomenon as novel

	however, it is unknown whether the energetic cost of walking is also
	an important contributor to usual gait speed when considered as a
	component of peak walking capacity.The energetic cost of 5 mins of
	slow treadmill walking (0.67 m/sec), peak overground walking energy
	expenditure, and usual gait speed over 6 m were assessed cross-sectionally
	in 405 adults aged 33 to 94 yrs in the Baltimore Longitudinal Study
	of Aging.Mean (SD) energy expenditures during slow and peak sustained
	walking were 8.9 (1.4) and 18.38 (4.8) ml kg(-1) min(-1), respectively.
	Overall, the energetic cost of slow walking as a percentage of peak
	walking energy expenditure was strongly associated with usual gait
	speed (P < 0.001); however in stratified analyses, this association
	was maintained only in those with peak walking capacity below 18.3
	ml kg(-1) min(-1) (P = 0.04), the threshold associated with independent
	living.In older persons with substantially reduced peak walking capacity,
	the energetic cost of walking is associated with gait speed, particularly
	when peak walking capacity nears the minimum level considered necessary
	for independent living. Thus, optimal habilitation in older frail
	persons may benefit from both improving fitness and reducing the
	energetic cost of walking.},

  abstract = {The capacity to walk independently is a central component of independent
	living. Numerous large and well-designed longitudinal studies have
	shown that gait speed, a reliable marker of mobility, tends to decline
	with age and as a consequence of chronic disease. This decline in
	performance is of utmost importance because slow walking speed is
	a strong, independent predictor of disability, healthcare utilization,
	nursing home admission, and mortality. Based on these robust findings,
	it has been postulated that age-associated decline in walking speed
	is a reliable barometer of the effect of biological aging on health
	and functional status. Despite the extraordinary prognostic information
	that walking speed provides, which is often superior to traditional
	medical information, there is a limited understanding of the mechanisms
	that underlie age- and disease-related gait speed decline. Identifying
	the mechanisms that underlie the prognostic value of walking speed
	should be a central theme in the design of the next generation of
	longitudinal studies of aging, with appropriate measures introduced
	and analytical approaches incorporated. This study hypothesized that
	a scarcity of available energy induces the decline in customary walking
	speed with aging and disease. Based on work in the Baltimore Longitudinal
	Study of Aging, examples of measures, operationalized dimensions,
	and analytical models that may be implemented to address this are
	provided. The main premise is simple: the biochemical processes that
	maintain life, secure homeostatic equilibrium, and prevent the collapse
	of health require energy. If energy becomes deficient, adaptive behaviors
	develop to conserve energy.},

  abstract = {Spasticity is only one of several components of the upper motor neurone
	(UMN) syndrome, known collectively as the 'positive' phenomena, that
	are characterized by muscle overactivity. Other components include
	tendon hyper-reflexia, clonus, the clasp-knife phenomenon, flexor
	and extensor spasms, a Babinski sign, and spastic dystonia. Spasticity
	is a form of hypertonia due to hyperexcitable tonic stretch reflexes.
	It is distinguished from rigidity by its dependence upon the speed
	of the muscle stretch and by the presence of other positive UMN signs.
	Hyperactive spinal reflexes mediate most of these positive phenomena,
	while others are due to disordered control of voluntary movement
	or abnormal efferent drive. An UMN lesion disturbs the balance of
	supraspinal inhibitory and excitatory inputs, producing a state of
	net disinhibition of the spinal reflexes. These include proprioceptive
	(stretch) and nociceptive (flexor withdrawal and extensor) reflexes.
	The clinical syndrome resulting from an UMN lesion depends more upon
	its location and extent, and the time since it occurred, than on
	the pathology of the lesion. However, the change in spinal reflex
	excitability cannot simply be due to an imbalance in supraspinal
	control. The delayed onset after the lesion and the frequent reduction
	in reflex excitability over time, suggests plasticity in the central
	nervous system. Knowledge of the electrophysiology and neurochemistry
	of spinal reflexes, together with the action of antispasticity drugs,
	helps us to understand the pathophysiology of spasticity.},

	to be especially representative: 1) the angle related to a very slight

	In children with CP and with muscle hypoextensibility, both angles

	produces full plantar flexion; in some children with CP, contraction
	fails to produce any force in full plantar flexion. Instead, force
	is generated only at a smaller tibiocalcanean angle when the muscle

	survivors, who reported the global and domain specific life satisfaction
	that they experienced (7 items, 6 graded-ordinal scales). Reference
	subjects were 60 healthy individuals in two age cohorts (60-61 years,
	n = 34; 79-81 years, n = 26) none of whom had been hospitalized during
	the last seven years prior to the investigation. The main finding
	is that, after the stroke, at least one aspect of the quality of
	life had decreased for 61\% of them; this concerned global, sexual
	and leisure satisfaction mainly. Moreover, persisting motor impairment
	and ADL-disability had a negative effect on several aspects of life
	satisfaction. As nearly 30\% of the non-impaired and the non-disabled
	interviewees reported decreased global life satisfaction, these changes
	indicate that they do not cope psychosocially with the stroke as
	such nor with its sequelae. In contrast, the levels of life satisfaction
	were similar for the 60-61 and 79-81 year-old interviewees, clinically
	healthy respondents, indicating stability in the quality of life
	that they experienced from late middle age into senectitude. For
	the patients, social integration estimated normatively did not covariate
	significantly with post-stroke satisfaction derived from social relationships.},

  abstract = {As the neural network becomes wired, postsynaptic signaling molecules
	are thought to control the growth of dendrites and synapses. However,
	how these molecules are coordinated to sculpt postsynaptic structures
	is less well understood. We find that ephrin-B3, a transmembrane
	ligand for Eph receptors, functions postsynaptically as a receptor
	to transduce reverse signals into developing dendrites of mouse hippocampal
	neurons. Both tyrosine phosphorylation-dependent GRB4 SH2/SH3 adaptor-mediated
	signals and PSD-95-discs large-zona occludens-1 (PDZ) domain-dependent
	signals are required for inhibition of dendrite branching, whereas
	only PDZ interactions are necessary for spine formation and excitatory
	synaptic function. PICK1 and syntenin, two PDZ domain proteins, participate
	with ephrin-B3 in these postsynaptic activities. PICK1 has a specific
	role in spine and synapse formation, and syntenin promotes both dendrite
	pruning and synapse formation to build postsynaptic structures that
	are essential for neural circuits. The study thus dissects ephrin-B
	reverse signaling into three distinct intracellular pathways and
	protein-protein interactions that mediate the maturation of postsynaptic
	neurons.},

	ribonucleic acid (mRNA) isolated from individual segments (T1 to
	T12) of rat spinal cord following graded impact trauma (50 or 100
	g/cm) to the T9 segment of pentobarbital-anesthetized rats. Trauma
	caused elevation of c-fos mRNA at the trauma site by 30 min after
	injury that was related to injury severity. At this time, increased
	levels of TNF-alpha (but not of preprodynorphin) mRNA were also found.
	By 24 h, c-fos and TNF-alpha mRNA had returned to normal levels at
	trauma site, but were now increased at more distal segments (T5 and
	T12). At 4 h after trauma, induction of preprodynorphin mRNA was
	detected at the trauma site; levels continued to be elevated at 24
	h when they were also detected at T5 and T12. Increases for each
	mRNA were greater for severe as compared to moderate trauma. The
